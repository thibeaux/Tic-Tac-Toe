# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a small single file game of Tic-Tac-Toe in python that takes user input in the terminal in order to play the game. The terminal syntax is to choose a position from 1-9 (top right box is 9, bottom left box is 1, just like your numberpad on your keyboard). Here is an example: >>9.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (7) | (8)  | (9)

  (4) | (5)  | (6)

  (1) | (2)  | (3)

# Tic-Tac-Toe future features and stuff in the works
Now, this is a work in prgress and isn't complete. There is still some bugs that need to be worked out I'm sure. As of now, to my knowledge, the program works great and you can now play PVP or AI depending on what file you download. In the future I may make both options into one program file with a start up menu. The computer on the Tic-Tac-Toe_Player_vs_AI file is able to execute defensive and offensive moves to strive for victory. The computer first tries to look for winning moves and then it will try to look for defensive moves before resorting to picking a random number to move to. By defensive moves I mean that the computer will try to block the player from winning and by offensive moves I mean that the computer will try to look for moves to win the game.
